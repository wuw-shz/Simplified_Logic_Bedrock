# SimplifiedLogic_Bedrock
I'm a computer science educator for young kids, and I wanted to teach them boolean algebra and logic gates.The problem: The regular way of making logic gates is multiple blocks in a specific configuration. Even if they are simple, small mistakes would lead to major time losses and would bog down the time we're supposed to be testing truth tables and boolean logic The solution: I made this addon that implements single-block logic gates. It works in both regular bedrock and the education edition preview (1.21.51 or later).

Here's the download link:
https://mcpedl.com/simplified-gates-edu-edition-compatible/

This addon currently includes the following:
- AND Gate
- OR Gate
- NAND Gate
- NOR Gate
- XOR Gate
- XNOR Gate
- NOT Gate
- Advanced Redstone Clock

All of these can only work in bedrock through a repeater placed in front. The repeater auto-places, so assume each gate is 2 blocks deep.

Note: This addon is still in development, and may contain bugs. Feel free to comment if you find any.
Here's a couple of features I'm working on including in future updates:
- Mux / Demux
- Encoder / Decoder
- Latches (RS, D, Maybe others)
- FlipFlops (D, T, J-K, Maybe others)

The following are just ideas, but I'd like to eventually include some boolean algreba features such as
- Truth Table Menus
- Karnaugh Map Menus
- Boolean Functions generated via Combinational Circuits
- Finally, I'd like to add that the purpose of this addon is for education. As such, I won't be using any experimental features in the future, and the content is safe for anyone and everyone

Happy Circuiting!
